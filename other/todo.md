# Contains notable featuers to be added into project.

## Easy Addition
Document tile mapping system and valid block types
Tile.js - Need to store sprite for that tile locally within the class.
Tile.js - SetVector2D, needs validation to check that it is within game bounds, or is atleast valid coords.
Document .tm extension.
Document out classes.
X and Y vectors are still flipped.
Create hash map from .tm files to actual types.


## Medium Addition
Validation for tilemapping, can handle erronous .tm files.
Allow manual modification of tile types, removing etc in real time.
	Update block types.
Optimise mouse movement code, it's horribly slow.
Optimise drawing code, it runs horrible, need to find a way to bring continious calculations down.
